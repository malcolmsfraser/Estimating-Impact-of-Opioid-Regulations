Over the past two decades, prescription opioid addiction and overdose deaths, resulting from the increased prescription and abuse of opioids, has wreaked havoc on communities across the Unites States. These problems have become one of the most pressing health concerns in the country. To decrease the severity of the problem at hand, many states have begun implementing policies with the goal of restricting the flow of prescription opioids. The goal of this analysis is to estimate the effectiveness of three such policy interventions implemented in Florida, Texas, and Washington state.
